## 1. Walrus Memory (MemWal)

### 1.1 What it is

A memory layer for AI agents that keeps context across sessions, apps and tools. Memories are:

- **embedded** for semantic search (by the relayer),
- **encrypted with Seal**,
- **stored as blobs on Walrus**,
- **owned onchain**: Sui smart contracts enforce ownership and delegate access.

Core operations:

| Operation  | What it does                                                                                      |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `remember` | Store one memory (embedding, Seal encryption, Walrus upload and indexing run as a background job) |
| `recall`   | Semantic search scoped to `owner + namespace`; returns decrypted text                             |
| `analyze`  | An LLM extracts facts from long text; each fact is stored as its own memory                       |
| `ask`      | Answer a query from recalled context plus LLM reasoning (listed in the Python SDK)                |
| `restore`  | Rebuild a lost index from Walrus by owner + namespace, re-embedding only missing entries          |

### 1.2 Key concepts

- **Memory space** = `owner address + namespace + app (package) ID`. It is the isolation boundary.
- **Owner:** a Sui address. It is the root authority over the account.
- **Delegate key:** an Ed25519 keypair the owner authorizes. Delegate keys are **registered onchain and
  verified on every request**, and the owner can add or remove them. This is how an app or agent writes to a
  _user's_ memory without owning it.
- **Namespace:** a label you choose, such as `rules`, `picks` or `group:123`. It defaults to `"default"`.
  Use one per product surface.
- **Account ID:** the `MemWalAccount` object ID on Sui.

### 1.3 Endpoints

| Network                                  | Relayer URL                                 |
| ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| **Mainnet (required for the hackathon)** | `https://relayer.memory.walrus.xyz`         |
| Testnet (staging)                        | `https://relayer-staging.memory.walrus.xyz` |

The managed relayer is a public good run by the Walrus Foundation: the server wallet pays Walrus storage
fees, there is no SLA, usage limits may apply, and **the relayer sees plaintext** during embedding and
encryption. For client-side encryption, use `MemWalManual`.

> Some docs pages (for example "Agent Storage Loop") use the **staging** relayer in their samples. The
> hackathon requires **Mainnet**, so don't copy those URLs as-is.

### 1.4 Install and configure (TypeScript)

```bash
pnpm add @mysten-incubation/memwal
# optional peers: ai (AI SDK middleware), @mysten/sui @mysten/seal @mysten/walrus (manual client)
```

```ts
import { MemWal } from "@mysten-incubation/memwal";

const memwal = MemWal.create({
  key: process.env.MEMWAL_KEY!, // delegate private key (hex, 0x-hex, suiprivkey1..., or Uint8Array)
  accountId: process.env.MEMWAL_ACCOUNT_ID!, // MemWalAccount object ID on Sui
  serverUrl: "https://relayer.memory.walrus.xyz",
  namespace: "my-app", // default "default"
  // requestTimeoutMs: 30000, recallTimeoutMs: 15000, preflightTimeoutMs: 5000
});

await memwal.health(); // reachability only; does NOT validate key/accountId
```

Python: `pip install memwal` (extras: `[langchain]`, `[openai]`, `[all]`). The `MemWal.create(key=..., account_id=..., server_url=..., namespace=...)` call mirrors the TS client.

### 1.6 Recall gotchas (these matter for "learning" apps)

- **`distance` is cosine distance: lower means more similar.** The MCP tool shows `score = 1 - distance`, the
  opposite polarity, so don't mix them.
- **The default ranking is relevance only, with no recency guarantee.** To get the _latest_ state (a current
  trust score, the newest rule), use `sort: "recent"`. Sorting client-side does **not** work, because the
  newest record may never make it into the result set.
- `sort: "recent"` over-fetches (`limit * 5`, capped at 50) and then orders by `created_at`.
- `scoringWeights: { semantic, recency, recencyHalfLifeDays, importance }` only **re-ranks** the returned
  candidates. It does not widen the search, and it's ignored when `sort` is set.
- `created_at` is the **write time**, not a date mentioned in the text.
- `maxDistance` filters client-side, after selection.

### 1.7 Design rule of thumb

Walrus Memory is **semantic memory, not a database**. Use it for what the product _learned_ (rules,
preferences, trust snapshots, insights) and for durable _proofs_. Keep counters, joins and balances in a
normal DB, and write the conclusions back to memory. Format memories as short, self-describing sentences or
`KEY: value` lines so semantic recall finds them.

### 1.8 AI SDK middleware

```ts
import { withMemWal } from "@mysten-incubation/memwal/ai";

const model = withMemWal(baseModel, {
  key,
  accountId,
  serverUrl,
  namespace: "chat",
  maxMemories: 5, // memories injected per request
  autoSave: true, // analyze() the user message after generation
  minRelevance: 0.3, // 0..1 similarity threshold
});
```

Before generation it recalls on the last user message and injects matches as a system message. After
generation it optionally runs `analyze()` and saves facts in the background. Use direct SDK calls when you
need precise control. Hunch does, so that every call can cite the memories it used (PRD §6.4).

### 1.9 Portable memory in AI tools (MCP)

Claude Code:

```
/plugin marketplace add MystenLabs/MemWal
/plugin install memwal@memwal-plugins
```

Tools: `memwal_login`, `memwal_remember`, `memwal_recall`. Codex, Cursor, Claude Desktop, Antigravity and
OpenCode are also documented under `docs.wal.app/walrus-memory/mcp/`. The same account gives the same
memories in every tool, which makes a strong "portable memory" demo.

### 1.11 Field notes (measured on mainnet)

Measured by the team on SDK 0.1.8, Sep–Oct 2026. Hunch pins 0.1.12, which adds `rememberBulk`,
`idempotencyKey` and `sort: "recent"`, so re-check a row before you lean on it.

| Topic            | What was measured                                                                                                                                                      | What to do                                                                                                                                                 |

| Sponsorship      | The relayer's `/sponsor` accepts **exactly one** of `create_account` / `add_delegate_key` / `remove_delegate_key` per tx.

## 2. Tatum

### 2.1 Auth

Get an API key from https://dashboard.tatum.io/ and send it as the **`x-api-key`** header, both for HTTP
and as gRPC metadata. Hunch uses the key only for gRPC (no JSON-RPC, [ADR-0002](https://github.com/UyLeQuoc/total-recall-hunch/blob/main/docs/adr/0002-sui-grpc-only.md)).

### 2.2 Sui RPC gateway: **gRPC only** ([ADR-0002](https://github.com/UyLeQuoc/total-recall-hunch/blob/main/docs/adr/0002-sui-grpc-only.md))

| Network     | gRPC (native, `x-api-key` metadata)         | JSON-RPC                   |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| **Mainnet** | `https://sui-mainnet-grpc.gateway.tatum.io` | not used (deprecated)      |
| Testnet     | `https://sui-testnet-grpc.gateway.tatum.io` | not offered by Tatum (404) |

- **Sui deprecated JSON-RPC.** Public fullnodes reject it ("JSON-RPC on public fullnodes has been
  deprecated"), so **Hunch uses gRPC everywhere**
  ([Tatum migration guide](https://docs.tatum.io/docs/sui-migration-guide-from-json-rpc-to-grpc)).
- **Tatum speaks native gRPC** (`application/grpc`). `@mysten/sui`'s `SuiGrpcClient` defaults to
  gRPC-web and fails with "unexpected response content type: application/grpc".
  - **Server side (verified):** `new SuiGrpcClient({ network, transport })` with a
    `GrpcTransport` from `@protobuf-ts/grpc-transport` + `@grpc/grpc-js`:
    `host: "sui-<net>-grpc.gateway.tatum.io:443"`, `ChannelCredentials.createSsl()`,
    `meta: { "x-api-key": key }`. It lives in `@hunch/chain` (`createTatumSuiClient`).
  - **Browser:** gRPC-web against a public fullnode (`https://fullnode.<network>.sui.io:443`), or go
    through our API.
- Build transactions client-side with the Sui SDK. Tatum doesn't support `unsafe_*` helpers.

gRPC v2 services we use:

| Need                                                | Service / method                                                                                                     |
| --------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Simulate (dry-run)                                  | `TransactionExecutionService.SimulateTransaction`                                                                    |
| Execute / settle                                    | `TransactionExecutionService.ExecuteTransaction`                                                                     |
| Transaction + events by digest                      | `LedgerService.GetTransaction` / `BatchGetTransactions`                                                              |
| Objects (Predict markets, UpgradeCap)               | `LedgerService.GetObject` / `BatchGetObjects`                                                                        |
| Checkpoints, chain info                             | `LedgerService.GetCheckpoint` / `GetServiceInfo`                                                                     |
| Balances (coins + address balance)                  | `StateService.GetBalance` / `ListBalances`: `Balance` has `balance`, `address_balance` and `coin_balance` separately |
| Owned objects, coin info, dynamic fields            | `StateService.ListOwnedObjects` / `GetCoinInfo` / `ListDynamicFields`                                                |
| Live chain events (opt-in fills on the demo screen) | `SubscriptionService.SubscribeCheckpoints`                                                                           |
| Move introspection                                  | `MovePackageService.GetPackage` / `GetFunction` / `GetDatatype`                                                      |
| SuiNS                                               | `NameService.LookupName` / `ReverseLookupName`                                                                       |

**There's no gRPC equivalent** of "query events by type" or "transactions by address". Hunch doesn't need
one: it knows its own digests, so it reads them with `GetTransaction`.

**Verified on Tatum testnet:** `SubscribeCheckpoints` streams through Tatum with a `TransactionFilter`
of `emitModule: "<pkg>::<module>"`.
- Frames without a match only advance `cursor`, about every 25 checkpoints.
- The stream starts at the tip; there's no start position. Backfill short gaps with
  `LedgerService.GetCheckpoint`.
- Streams can get HTTP 429 too, so reconnect with backoff.
- **A stream costs credits per frame:** even a filtered one sends about 720 frames an hour. Keep it off
  unless a screen needs it (PRD §11).

### 2.3 Data API (`/v4/data/...`)

| API                     | Paths                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Prices & exchange rates | `/v4/data/rate/symbol`, `/v4/data/rate/symbol/batch`, `/v4/data/rate/contract`, `/v4/data/rate/symbol/OHLCV`, `/v4/data/rate/price-change`, `/v4/data/rate/history` (price at any block or timestamp; 50 credits/call) |
| Wallet                  | `/v4/data/wallet/portfolio`, `/v4/data/wallet/balance/time`, `/v4/data/wallet/reputation`                                                                                                                              |
| Tokens                  | `/v4/data/tokens`, `/v4/data/owners`, `/v4/data/tokens/trending`, `/v4/data/tokens/popular`                                                                                                                            |
| Transactions            | `/v4/data/transaction/history`, `/v4/data/transactions/hash`                                                                                                                                                           |

Exchange rates cover crypto↔fiat and fiat↔fiat across 165+ fiat currencies. **Check chain support per
endpoint.** Many Data API endpoints are EVM/UTXO-first, so for Sui-native data use the Sui RPC.

### 2.4 Notifications (webhooks)

`/v4/subscription`, `/v4/subscription/webhook`, ... Call `GET /v4/subscription/chains` (free) to see whether
Sui alerts are supported before designing around them. The fallback is the gRPC checkpoint stream.

### 2.5 Tatum AI Builder

[ai.tatum.io](https://ai.tatum.io) generates a working blockchain app from one prompt. Showcase apps run on
`*.tatum.app`, and one of them (AgentPact) already uses Walrus. Related tools: **Blockchain MCP** (68 chains,
13 tools, read-only by default) and **Tatum Skills** (codegen guidance). The **Best Tatum AI Builder App**
prize requires the product to be built _primarily_ with it.

## 3. Sui pieces Hunch uses

### 3.1 Gas

- **Sponsored transactions:** the sender and the sponsor both sign. `SUI_SPONSOR_KEY` pays the anchors'
  gas, so users hold no SUI.
- **Gas from the address balance** (`enable_address_balance_gas_payments`, on both networks): the SDK pays
  gas from the gas owner's address balance when it has one. When it pays partly from the address balance
  and partly with a coin, the coin is deleted and its value lands in the address balance.

### 3.2 DeepBook Predict (testnet; the spike is P0, trading P1)

- BTC/USD markets that expire every 1 or 5 minutes, live on Sui since Sep 12, 2026. A position pays a fixed
  amount if the price settles inside its range; USDC collateral, a liquidity pool on the other side;
  anyone can settle, from Pyth's price at expiry.
- SDK: `@mysten/deepbook-v3@2.9.1` (`/predict`, `/sessions`), on `SuiGrpcClient`, so every call goes
  through Tatum. Testnet registry `0x85cf…ccc4` (check the SDK's constants for the full id).
- It fills only queued orders (`planMint`, then `enqueuePlan`, then `waitForOutcome`), takes none in the
  last ~10 s before expiry, and only between 0.15 and 0.85 probability; the premium is at least 1 USDC.
- **A session can trade but not withdraw, and has no spending cap.** Hunch checks a rule's limits before
  every order, and Pause all revokes the session.
- Test USDC has to be requested; it's on the Nov 2 list (PRD §14).
- Pyth's Hermes needs a key, so Pyth is only a cross-check; Predict settles itself.

### 3.3 Free market data (polling never uses Tatum)

The sources, their limits and what each is used for are in [the PRD §9](hunch-prd.md#9-data-sources).
